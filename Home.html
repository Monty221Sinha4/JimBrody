    </div>
    <div class="align-text-bottom">
     <p>As-Built Solutions LLC provides identification of the design process upon completion of the construction phase.  We have over 100 years of combined experience in architecture, engineering and maintenance projects.  Through years of professional experience, we have learned that accurate as-built drawings save time, energy and dollars.  Without complete and accurate as-built drawings individuals must rely on the experiences and learned knowledge of previous vendors or personel.  Eventually through trial and error these owners realize what they paid for were construction drawings and not true drawings reflecting existing condidtions.  If there are no true as-built drawings, they must be generated.  This is where As-Built Solutions LLC services can be beneficial.</p>

        We at ABS focus exclusively on high rise, residential and commericial, health care and educationsl facilities providing true as-built drawings of the architectural, mechanical inclusive of medical gas, plumbing, fire protection and electrical systems.  We produce accurate CADD drawings after extensive and comprehensive field verification

    <div class="align-text-bottom">
        <p>this process of providing accurate as-built drawings comes into question at every upcoming renovation, acquisition, expansion or sale.  The consequences of not having these documents results in inaccurate design drawings and eventually change orders.  We elimate the addditional costs associated with this problem</p>
